This is a fullstack project I developed to manage products in an inventory management system. I built an intuitive and user-friendly interface, 
ensuring a smooth experience for the end user, with validations to maintain the integrity of all actions performed.

Here are some of the key features:

✅ User Registration:
The system allows new users to register, storing essential information such as name, email, and password, ensuring security with password hashing.

✅ Secure Login:
User authentication with password encryption, allowing access only to registered users.

✅ Stock Management:
Users can add, edit, and delete products from the stock quickly and intuitively.

✅ Product Registration:
Each product can be registered with a name, quantity, price, and category, ensuring organization in stock control.

✅ Product Editing:
The system allows updating any product information, such as price or quantity, directly from the interface.

✅ Product Deletion:
Products can be removed from stock easily and quickly, keeping the database always up to date.

✅ Relational Database (MySQL):
Uses MySQL to efficiently store products and users, ensuring data integrity and organization.

✅ API with Node.js and Express:
A structured backend that enables communication between the database and the frontend, allowing secure CRUD operations.

✅ Validations and User Feedback:
The system includes validations to ensure data consistency, along with error and success messages for better usability.
